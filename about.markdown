Let me introduce myself.


![Ian Gray]({{ site.baseurl }}https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51367971?s=460&u=e16d9afa8029e7f2676089c184856d004dfa54a7&v=4 "Ian Gray")
 
My name is Ian and I'm a seasoned generalist with a background in operations and project management within Australia. As a self-proclaimed jack-of-all-trades I am currently pursuing undergraduate studies in economics and business analytics while I freelance.

Resourcefulness is an attribute that I value greatly and I enjoy the challenges brought by new situations, especially when overcoming requires a lateral approach or the combination of ideas into a novel solution. My adaptability and resilience in the face of opposition, as well as my strongly analytical mindset, are my greatest strengths. I pursue the desired outcome with vision, tenacity and composure.

On a more personal level I lead a relatively minimalist lifestyle. I carry very few personal possessions and enjoy the sense of freedom and simplicity that brings. I'm very much a "place for everything, and everything in its place" kind of person. I enjoy reading, exploring new food, as well as learning and practicing languages with my friends all over the world.

That's me in a nutshell. Reach out on Twitter @theiangray if you want to chat!

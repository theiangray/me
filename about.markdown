My name is Ian and I'm a data analyst and seasoned business generalist with a background in operations and project management. I cut my teeth working in the field as a technician and understand what is needed to drive business growth. I am currently pursuing my well overdue undergraduate studies in economics and business analytics while residing in the great Kingdom of Cambodia!

### The Career ###
My first job was as a junior computer technician in a small shop in Far North Queensland while I was in high school. I recall dropping off my resume and being so determined to get the job that I returned each weekend to check if they were still considering hiring someone. It worked, and I scored the job repairing computers after school and on weekends. I eventually moved to Townsville after I finished school to chase bigger and better opportunities which, after a few gigs delivering pizza and stocking shelves, lead me to an apprenticeship as an electronics and telecommunications technician. Many long days and nights were spent repairing all sorts of gear and running cables through dusty, somewhat dilapidated rural pub ceilings but I gained a great deal of hands-on experience in the process. 

My commitment paid off and eventually lead to me being able to lead small teams installing telco systems and infrastructure before I picked up whole projects to manage. After a few years of managing projects from telco infrastructure through to civil construction I earned a seat as an operations manager. I took over management of a new branch in Cairns and after around 12 months I decided it was time to take the plunge and change careers. Over the years I had always had a penchant for using data to create insights to help inform my decisions and I knew that was the direction I needed to go. I continued working while I obtained my Diploma in Business before applying to Deakin University to undertake a dual major in Economics and Business Analytics.

### The Man ###
I've always been an inquisitive soul with a tendancy to understand not only the "how" but the "why". I value resourcefulness and adaptability. Although I enjoy working as a team to achieve something greater I am drawn to an element of my personality which dictates a certain self-sufficiency. I think this is why my drive to capture and analyse data is as present as it is, because at the core of being independent is understanding the world around us as comprehensively as possible; Being able to see the environment as one system yet fluidly zoom to examine the granular details that contribute to that whole. 

This broad curiosity has almost definitely lead me to be the generalist that I am. In both my professional and personal life I consider myself to be broadly competent but not a specialist. This understanding has informed my decision to begin a life-long journey into specialising into the most ironically generalist-inclined field - Economics. 

Aside from this I lead a relatively minimalist lifestyle as I feel it keeps my mind clear. I maintain an impressively light collection of neccesary possessions which all pack into a 45L bag and it serves me quite well!

I'm a keen motorcyclist and I absolutely love the freedom and simplicity of two-wheeled travel. My hobbies include solving problems and riddles for a kick and reading, especially ancient history. Food gets me excited and is probably my principle reason for travel to most places. I love meeting new people and sharing a meal! As a consequence I'm also big on learning languages; My native tongue is English but I can also speak conversationally in Indonesian and Malaysian, and I'm always learning new words wiht my mates in Swahili, Arabic, German, and French. 

That's me in a nutshell. Reach out on Twitter @theiangray if you want to chat!

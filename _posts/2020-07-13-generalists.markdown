## What is a generalist? But really, what is a generalist? ###
Generalists are all-rounders with knowledge and skills spread across the board. They're the antithesis of specialists, who are highly trained experts in a narrow domain of interest. Broadly speaking - pun intended - generalists know something about everything, but not everything about anything. Capiche? Clear as mud? Okay, so what REALLY is a generalist within the context of the business world? A generalist is the expeditor, translator, co-ordinator, and advocate. If you point me in the direction of the product owner at a software company, I'll show you the generalist in the room. The chef who runs the pass in your favourite restaurant? Generalist. The serial entrepreneur? You guessed it - generalist again. 

The concept of a jack-of-all-trades applied to the real world is that person around the office who seems to be able to blur the lines that delineate the skilled verticals and float from one position to another like a sweet, summer breeze. What I'm trying to get at here is that generalists are not only valuable but they are a necessity within any good organisation. Not only are they a conduit between business areas, but they are the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter of the workplace. A multi-role warrior who ties the team together in the battle towards profitability. Alone a generalist is somewhat lacking, but as part of a well-balanced team they provide an intangible strategic advantage over the competition by constantly watching the bigger picture from different angles to lock in that missing piece. 

Now I know what you're thinking: _"I know a bunch of those people and they're specialists!"_ and you're probably not incorrect either. 

_"What??? Now you're just talking shit, Ian!"_ Nope. Let me enlighten you. 

Every time I read an article on generalists and specialists within the business world it seems to be so clear cut. You're either this or you're that. Black and white. Possibly because people really love to pack things neatly into labelled categories and that extends to just about every aspect of our lives. The reality is that this is not the case. Life is a fucking mess most times and the business world follows suit. That might sound a little negative but just hold onto your horses for one minute-o! Just because everything is messy doesn't mean it's not good. I'm all for some Marie Kondo-esque organisation of my living quarters, but I think the popularity of these types of consultants and organisational systems speaks to just how chaotic the real world is. When it comes to the roles we play in the workplace we very rarely find ourselves limited to the responsibilities inked on the contract. Most, if not all of the time, we're doing our best to fulfil our stated duties and picking up the slack around us as we go. We're learning about the roles of those around us and the roles we want to fill. We're digging deeper into our specialty but we're also slowly carving out a set of experiences around us that give us perspective. This is what I'm talking about.

Every single person reading this is both a specialist and a generalist in their own right. We are all a blend of both categories in varying proportions and it's the specific combination of those little bits and pieces of skills and knowledge that gives us our uniqueness and our value to an employer. So what's the point of this article? Well, I wanted to first of all highlight what a generalist is, and then why we should all be at least a little bit general.

I have a certain predilection for using biological analogies wherever possible because, to me at least, they carry some kind of weight by necessity of having evolved that way. So I'm going to use a particularly excellent analogy for the generalist/specialist idea that I found. Do you like owls? Hoo doesn't, am I right?! Jokes aside, if we peep into the animal kingdom, and in particular at the powerful owl endemic to Australia we find a great example of why it's an absolutely brilliant idea to be both a generalist and a specialist. As Jerry Olsen mentions(2002, p. 213)  the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) is an apex predator and diet specialist with its diet consisting predominantly of arboreal mammals like possums, but it's also an amazing generalist in the habitation of huge tracts of land up and down the south-east coast of Australia. 

The specialisation allows the powerful owl to completely own the predation of a niche of poor little fuzzy bastards, while also applying that killer skill to a very large geographic area and remaining resilient to environmental change. So, be a powerful owl. That's the message. If you're a specialist, take some of that fuzzy rodent-killer specialisation and learn how other functional areas interact and apply that skill. Try to see the bigger picture with a bit more detail. If you're a generalist already, then try to find a niche where you can dig in a bit of an anchor. That powerful owl isn't much good for anything if he can't get those beefy talons into some supple possum. Work on finding where your minor specialisation is and dig yourself a cosy little nook from which to observe your generalist estate.
 
What does it mean to be a generalist in business? Here's a very non-exhaustive list of the pros and cons of playing strongly towards the generalist side of the scale. 

#### Benefits of being a generalist ####
* Useful in creating novel solutions by combining knowledge from other areas.
* Good at being the glue of an organisation that holds all the specialist pieces in place.
* Fantastic at playing the cross-functional expeditor role when the business is on a short runway. 
* Valuable resource for a small organisation that needs to pivot quickly or often. 

#### Disadvantages of being a generalist ####
* Not a specialist! No deep knowledge in one area.
* Loosely defined job roles can make career growth slow.
* Success depends on maintaining a broad understanding of the environment to be able to operate effectively. If you get left behind, you lose any tactical advantage against the specialists which means you just become a jack-of-no-trades.
* Spread too wide and you risk putting in effort into areas that aren't likely to be useful.
* Generalist that don't pull their weight are replaceable. Specialists for a given role are much more difficult to replace owing to the uniqueness of their training. A generalist on the other hand always has a queue of willing replacements if he makes a mistake or fails to cut the mustard!

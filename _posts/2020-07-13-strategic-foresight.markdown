We're living in very uncertain times at the moment, and if I could pin the tail of blame on the scapegoat's ass it would be the inability of us feeble humans to predict the future. We work so diligently to extrapolate then interpolate and then extrapolate some more that we sometimes find ourselves focusing on the finest of details and end up between a rock and a hard place.
Could I predict how chaotic and unpredictable things were going to be? Nope. Not in the slightest. I'll tell you what I could do though - I managed to remain agile and resilient in the face of a world falling apart.

How did I do that? Strategic foresight
"What is that?!" you bellow from your quarantine den. Well I'm glad you asked! Strategic foresight is just an approach to planning that allows us to develop a super high-definition, comprehensive picture of our operating environment so we can make informed decisions about how to handle future uncertainty. We do this by getting into character and playing some imaginary war games with our mates. Have you ever played Dungeons & Dragons? No? Well I have and I'd highly recommend it because it perfectly highlights the skills you will need for scenario planning.

The basic premise is that we take a snapshot of our current situation, and that includes both the business as well as the immediate and broader environment. From this snapshot we develop a number of possible storylines or scenarios that could occur which would create some kind of conflict for us. Think, oh I don't know, a global pandemic.

Now that we have our scenarios we break up into teams if possible and work our way through these by considering all of the possible ways to reduce or eliminate the risks created, and how these solutions could be primed for action if the scenario was to occur.

From here we look over all the solutions that we've come up with and see if we can find some common strategies that apply broadly and will give us some great bang for our buck while still remaining effective and agile. Don't forget agile. ALWAYS aim for agile.

Scenario planning like this requires strong leadership and a commitment to follow through on the plans and solutions that are developed, otherwise it's all just a bunch of poppycock with added team bonding on the company's tab at the local pub. For strategic foresight, and in particular scenario planning to be effective it needs to be a part of the leadership philosophy that you bring to the team. It needs to be a continuous thread of vigilance and imaginative vision in order to be successful.
We're probably all very aware that continuous improvement processes are a solid idea but these processes are typically focused on operational stuff here and now to fix issues and streamline. My suggestion would be that this type of scenario planning is integrated into your continuous improvement processes as well as into your standard financial forecasting process. That way you're picking up the operational AND financial pieces of the puzzle and not neglecting potentially valuable stakeholder perspectives and info.

So, now that we know what strategic foresight is and how scenario planning works, I hear you asking "Does this apply to our current situation, Ian?" and "Does this have anything to do with rally cars?". The answer to both is a resounding yes.

### The rally car analogy ###

I don't know about you, but I love to watch some World Rally Championship on the telly. Exceptionally talented drivers launching their high-powered buckets of alloyed metal down dusty roads towards glory is my kind of entertainment!
Anyway, I like to think of an organisation using the metaphor of a vehicle sometimes. I reckon there are some parallels between a CEO at the head of a business in the face of a global pandemic and a driver at the wheel of a race car hurtling down a winding track. We need to keep our car on the road (maintain liquidity), keep our eyes focused on the next turn (strategic planning), and prepare ourselves to push hard when the road opens up (operational readiness).
As we approach an unknown corner we need to check our speed and constantly assess the environment. Enter the corner wide to give ourselves options, feather the brakes, be in the right gear, and be ready to power out of the corner once the road straightens.

When it comes to what's around the next blind corner we have to make a few assumptions - projections in business-land talk.  We basically have two options when it comes to making projections in this kind of situation as I see it. The first is that we can examine historical data and then extend that pattern forward in time, which is fair and reasonable thing to do. The second is to take a step back to see the forest for the trees and then use our top-notch human imaginations to consider some possible scenarios, especially the ones where everything goes to shit. This is scenario planning, and it works by giving us a bunch of possible future scenarios that we probably wouldn't have come up with otherwise. By assessing each possible future scenario and coming up with ways to best plan for those instances, we can look across the board and seek out the most strategically sound common solutions.

Back in the world of the rally car driver, if we make a projection on what's around the next corner based on the road already covered we could find ourselves in big trouble if we haven't previously encountered a change in road surface or a lost dog. We've made too many assumptions about the road ahead and we've hit a poor little puppy! On the other hand, if we use scenario planning we could consider that we are driving in a residential area and infer from this knowledge that there may be domestic animals roaming the area. In that case we stand a much better chance of preparing to see, and consequently reacting to, Spot, the lost doggo.

In either option we're making assumptions, but we're doing so in a calculated way in an attempt to mitigate risk, because we're basically living in a risk dominated world at the moment. Ideally we want to combine both of these predictive methods and overlay our historical predictions with some common-sense, holistic, low-fat, low-carb scenario planning to sanity check things.
So what can we do within the business to stay responsive? How do we keep this car on the road?

#### Keep your damn eyes on the road! ####
Model worst-case scenarios especially as they pertain to your cash position. Consider how your scenario plans could impact these projections. Understand and plan for the financial reporting considerations that will result from COVID-19.

#### Keep your foot near the accelerator & brake pedals ####
Identify your critical operational and financial levers that can be pulled to safe or generate cash.

#### Think about the next corner ####
Assess potential prospects from tax relief provisions or other measures. We're in unprecedented times and that means that there are new policies in flight that haven't yet landed, and money being poured into new buckets which you might be able to access.

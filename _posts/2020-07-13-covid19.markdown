Now I'm well aware that everyone has their very own story of how the global pandemic has impacted their life and the lives of everyone around them, but for posterity sake I'm going to endeavour to tell mine here. 
I'd like to preface this story by giving you a little bit of background first. In mid 2019 I had made a decision to sell my shit, pack my bags, and travel to Kenya to be with my girlfriend. It was a risky decision but I thought "ah, why not? What's the worst that could happen?". Fast forward to late 2019, I was finalising my affairs in Cairns before boarding a plane and leaving the shores of Australia for an unknown amount of time. I had sold everything bar a few sets of clothes, my laptop and kindle, and a couple of books - Whatever I could fit in a backpack, basically. On Wednesday 11th December 2019 I checked in my bag and jumped on a 737-800 for the first of a series of flights to Jamhuri ya Kenya! Cairns has an international airport, but for some reason I always have to transfer through Brisbane or Melbourne first. So along I went, with the usual delays and gate changes you get when you pick the cheapest tickets, through Brisbane to Abu Dhabi before finally touching down at Jomo Kenyatta Airport in Nairobi. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed being back in Nairobi and spending time with my girlfriend and her family. We were only going to stay for a little while though, just until after Christmas because Lydia, my better half, had some success with job applications and lined up some job interviews with companies in Kuala Lumpur. So on the 27th of December we said our goodbyes and embarked on an exciting trip to Malaysia! We transited through Dubai to Kuala Lumpur and found ourselves in a couple of cheap hotels before we nailed down some cheap co-living accommodation.
 
This is where my COVID-19 story begins. I'm sure by this time there was some knowledge of the coronavirus within China, but we were blissfully unaware and entirely preoccupied with the anxieties of job interviews and college exams. I had been studying my undergrad degree since mid 2019 so I had some exams at the British Council in Kuala Lumpur and afterwards we made a couple of bus and train trips to Ipoh and Penang in the north. Lydia's job interviews had been going well, but there was some apprehension in the voices of the recruiters with the looming virus. It's as if everyone was going through the motions of daily life with their eyes fixed on the viral train wreck unfolding in front of us. It's about here that things start to get a little fucky. Now news was starting to break that this situation was getting out of hand and there was an air of panic starting to brew. I could feel it in my bones, man. So Lydia and I reviewed some of the information that was coming out and tried to assess what our game plan should be, bearing in mind that we had only been issued 90 day visa-free stamps in our passports and were obligated to leave before they expired. 

We made a list of the best countries that we would be able to gain visas for and sustain ourselves in for the duration of a lockdown so we could resume the job hunt afterwards. This was made somewhat complicated by the fact that an Australian visa for Lydia would take quite some time to be approved and I had just sold all of my shit and given up my place of residence. Further complicating the issue was that Lydia's passport is South Sudanese, and due to some ongoing conflict there are only a handful of countries that don't require extensive visa application processes. Maybe a day or two after we had made this list some borders started to close and the list shortened. We resolved to fly to Cambodia as the visa on arrival process was still operating and it seemed like an affordable and safe country to sail through a lockdown in. We booked flights for the 25th of March only to find that AirAsia cancelled the route. We swiftly picked the next available carrier which was Jetstart Asia and booked for the 20th instead. We still had time left on our passports in Malaysia but we didn't want to take the risk of having to potentially live in an airport like that Spielberg film. 

We managed to board from Kuala Lumpur and fly to Singapore to transit to Phnom Penh (phew!). We must have been on one of the only flights operating by this point though because the normally busy Changi airport was like a ghost town. 
We had some minor confusion and a bit of a problem with the visa on arrival process but we managed to at least get into Cambodia. Immigration had granted me an ordinary visa but they refused to issue Lydia anything except a tourist visa, despite the advice provided by the Cambodian embassy prior. At least we had some more time up our sleeves!
At first we had booked into a cheap-ish hotel to assess the landscape. There was no such thing as a mandatory quarantine, just a yellow pamphlet issued to us at the airport to take to a doctor if we developed symptoms. We self-quarantined for 14 days anyway because: 1. It's the right thing to do, kids; and 2. We're hermits anyway. 
 
Since then there has been some minor restrictions of movement and most Cambodians diligently wear masks whenever they leave their homes, but the officially reported cases never really climbed as witnessed in other countries. I'll leave it up to your best judgement to determine the reason for why that is. That pretty much brings us up to today. Needless to say, we have maintained our distancing practices and have shuffled around to a few different places of residence within Phnom Penh in search of better value rent, and more reliable power and internet. To be honest, power and internet is pretty good here. The rent is surprisingly more expensive than I thought it would be, but that's probably partly due Cambodia's currency, the Riel, being so heavily tied to the value of the US dollar, and my currency, the Australian Dollar, soaring like a brick as people exit from risk markets. The internet is patchy sometimes, but that's only because I had become accustomed to the delightful Safaricom broadband in Nairobi. Cambodia is still leagues ahead of rural Australia (Yeah, fuck you Telstra).

### UPDATE: 2020-07-13 ### 
With what seemed like a reduced risk of COVID exposure we bit the bullet and decided to head to Krong Siem Reap which is about 6 hours by bus from Phnom Penh. I checked out some accommodation and found a cracker of a place halfway between the city center and Angkor Wat, so I booked that and a couple of bus tickets. We woke up early to clean the apartment before we departed and then finished packing to head to the bus station by about 7:30 am. The tuk-tuk I ordered on PassApp didn't turn up so I ordered a Grab instead and he dropped us at an intersection near Olympic Market. 

After testing the limits of my Khmer we found the bus station and confirmed our tickets. A minivan pulled up so we threw our bags in and away we went. We only got to the north side of town before the bus stopped and everyone emptied out. The bus driver managed to communicate that we had to change into a different minibus and after a little confusion and showing another bloke our bus ticket he allocated us a seat in the new bus. Away we went by about 8 am. The bus stopped a couple of times along the way at random stops to pick up some mail or drop something off. At one point the door swung open and a lady offered everyone what looked like some roasted crickets before we all politely declined and the bus continued on. The driver seemed excited to get there quickly easily doing 130km/h on a few stretches, but then he pulled over at a cafe for lunch which lasted about 45 minutes - I'm not really sure why.

The remainder of the trip was pretty uneventful and the bloke from the accommodation organised a tuktuk to collect us from the bus depot. We settled in to our new digs and ordered some food. Happy days!

I spoke to the owner of the AirBnB, a very intelligent and well travelled Cambodian bloke, and he invited me to breakfast a few times at a local cafe that serves some fantastic coffee and bread. Many good chats have been had so far and the place has been spectacularly quiet and peaceful with the exception of about three days of earsplitting music from a neighbouring property which apparently is a funeral tradition. We did have one brief encounter with a fairly angry black scorpion finding its way into our living quarters which was exciting.

Anyway that bring you up to speed on my COVID-19 story. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I'll continue to keep this updated as the story progresses!
